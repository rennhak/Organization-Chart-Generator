- Current system is based on the free version of PBWorks.
- Every interesting entry in the Wiki for us contains the word "Team List"
- In every subpage of "x Team List" there is a table which is originally imported from Excel
- In this table there is name and position which we extract
- This will be stored in a flatfile sqlite DB
- From the DB we generate our dot file according to a simple hierarchy scheme
