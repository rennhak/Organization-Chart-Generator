Organization Chart Generator
----------------------------

Living Dreams is a fast growing Non Profit Organization (NPO), which has many people joining or
dropping out over time. It is cumbersome to manage some kind of Organizational chart by hand since
a computer can do that for us automatically.

This program will download and parse the necesary information and generate via GraphViz a simple
Organizational Chart in various formats. These charts can then be used in presentations or other
occasions.
