Organization Chart Generator
----------------------------

Fast growing Non-Profit Organizations (NPO) have many people joining or
dropping out over time. It is cumbersome to manage some kind of Organizational chart by hand since
a computer can do that for us automatically.

This program will download and parse the necesary information and generate via GraphViz a simple
Organizational Chart in various formats. These charts can then be used in presentations or other
occasions.

It is currently based on PBWorks Wiki (Free version) and expects certain hardcoded pages that have
"Team List" in it. From these pages tables are extracted and processed into a graphviz dot file.
Finally, to provide a nice formatting and color layout a xsl sheet is used to beautify the SVG output.
